# Greetings fellow travelers! Congratulations. You have followed the path and wandered into my humble project repository. Grab a drink, sit down, and have a look around ☕📘.

<p>Here you will find a collection of various projects that I have worked on, ranging from data automation, analytics, and visualisation to personal projects that I have undertaken for fun and learning.</p> 
<p>Feel free to explore the different folders and files to see some of the work that I have done. Each project is organised in its own folder, with a README file that provides an overview of the project, its purpose, and any other relevant information.</p> 
<p>Happy exploring!</p>
